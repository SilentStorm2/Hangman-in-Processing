Trying to make the game Hangman in Processing using Python

I am currently trying to make the game Hangman using Python in Processing. I have the code to run the game, as well as code for some visuals. The problem is combining the code I've written so far. The game code is written in standard Python, while the visuals code is written in Processing. Can someone please help me combine the two and make a working Hangman game in Processing? Thank you in advance.
